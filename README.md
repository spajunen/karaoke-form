# Karaoke sign up application

Registration form for karaoke.

## About the Project

This application is developed as a assignment from Pandia, as a part of interview process for Junior Frontend Developer job.

### Problem

This application can be used as a sign up form for karaoke.

### Requirements

Create a registration form for karaoke according to Kennon's visual appearance. The form should be clickable, but it does not need to send or save any data anywhere. 

The registration form must include the following mandatory fields:

- Name or nickname
- Song - dropdown menu where you can enter artists and songs according to your taste
- Key, where the user can choose their key on a scale of -2 to +2
- Checkbox, Allow saving my information in the karaoke system

Design and implement the form according to good programming practices.

- Bonus - Optionally, you can add a field for importing a voluntary profile picture.
- Bonus - Add validation to the Register button so that all mandatory fields are definitely entered.
- Bonus - Add a loading animation to the Register button that appears when clicked (note: the form does not need to save data).

### Further development
- implement rest of bonus tasks
- refactor radiobutton (make reusable, investigate why can be pressed only from the top)
- mobile view 
- backend
- display line of singers and waiting time
